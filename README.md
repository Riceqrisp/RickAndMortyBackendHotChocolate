 Basic usage of GraphQL
 
 Some resources I used to create the endpoint:
 
 https://blog.christian-schou.dk/how-to-implement-graphql-in-asp-net-core/ - initial structure and prospect of how the api should be structured, altough I didn't follow all the same structure and created a custom folder tree.
 
 https://chillicream.com/docs/hotchocolate - all simple an really functional for how to use GraphQL.

 https://github.com/ChilliCream/hotchocolate-examples/tree/master/misc/Testing - both for testing purposes, I am familiar with the approach and aware there is a bit more optimisation that unit tests could be using although for this amount of demonstration data I am not using it as in the repository of ChiliCream. Altough it could be changed and optimised in this way.
